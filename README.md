# AtliQ_Mart_Supply_Chain_Analysis

The company is present in Vadodara, Surat, and Ahmedabad city and sells its various products in the Dairy, Food, and Beverages Categories. And the stakeholders are the director and head of the supply chain of 'AtliQ Mart.'

#Problem Statement
#Background
AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. It is currently operational in three cities Surat, Ahmedabad and Vadodra. They want to expand to other metro/tier1 cities in the next two years.

#Challenge
AtliQ Mart is facing a problem where a few key customers still need to extend their annual contracts due to service issues. It is speculated that some of the essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in total over a continued period, which could have resulted in bad customer service. Management wants to fix this issue before expanding to other cities and requested their supply chain analytics team to track the ’On time’ and ‘In Full’ delivery service level for all the customers daily so that they can respond swiftly to these issues.

The Supply Chain team decided to use a standard approach to measure the service level in which they will measure ‘on-time delivery (OT) %,’ ‘In-full delivery (IF) %’, and On Time in full (OTIF) % of the customer orders daily against the target service level set for each customer.
